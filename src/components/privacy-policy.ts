    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4) Legal Bases (If Applicable)</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, we rely on one or more legal bases to process your information, such as:
        <strong>contract performance</strong>, <strong>legitimate interests</strong>, <strong>consent</strong>,
        and <strong>legal compliance</strong>.

      </p>
      <ul>
